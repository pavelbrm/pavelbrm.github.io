With this post I continue publishing drafts of the book I've been working on since June 2020, Golocron – Software Development with Go. And this is the first post in a series of the new unit.

## Before We Begin

I ended last year with the post closing the first unit dedicated to project layout. If you have not read it yet, I highly recommend you reading it throught. The posts of the unit can be found by [the m1u1 tag](https://blog.pavelbrm.com/tags/#m1u1).

But it's time to move on, and this post opens up a series dedicated to the second unit of the book. The unit is called "Package Layout", and as the name suggests, it is about desiging packages. Here is what the unit is about:
- introduction to Go packages, and why it's important to get them right
- choosing a good name for a package
- structuring a package, and organising files in it
- designing packages in a cross-platform setup.

This post starts with a general introductin to the topic, and explains why it is important to design packages well in general, and in Go in particular.

I hope you'll find something interesting and helpful in this material.
