title: An Important Question

These days so many people don't know who they are.

People describe themselves in terms of many things - countries they was born and live in, cultures they belong to, religions they support or associate themselves with, jobs they have, their social roles, their children or lack of them. And not only that. Since the earliest days of the human history, people describe themselves by the money they make, by the things they own, with their bodies they've built in the gym (after or before the job they hate, to impress people they probably hate too). Houses, cars, even phones, - people use anything and everything to tell you who they are.

Does all this information really answer the question about who a person is? Do they know who they really are? Yes, all the external attributes, which most of people when introducing themselves, are little pieces of a puzzle. These pieces help to create a rough and approximate picture. But is this a real picture? Does this picture show the truth? What's in it?

A person is made of something more important than physical attributes. A person is made of principles, core values, attitudes, beliefs and fears. These concepts are the constructs we're as personalities are made of, driven by, live and act based on and according to. It's incredibly important to know what drives one or another, because it does so one even if they don't know or realise the fact.

Someone may argue though. One might say that the country they was born and live in defines who they are, and how they behave. While it's true in terms of how you interact with organisations, cars on the road, money and so forth, it has little to nothing to do with the foundation of your actions. Because the foundation is principles. Or, one might argue that the culture and religion is what makes them who they are. That's correct in terms of setting guidelines for interaction with others in certain situations. But it has nothing to do with the personal values. Even professions do not define who is who. But the attitude one has and expresses, the prism which they see and precieve the world through is something what makes a huge difference.

Principles are universal laws which do not depend on countries, religions, or anything else. They're timeless. Honesty, fairness, kindness, freedom, add yours. Regardless of the citizenship, principles, be they good or bad, make a person who they are. What one values the most at any given period of their life, defines what they will strive for. Attitude shows itself when one faces positive and negative situations, challenges, big gains and losses. What one believes in and has a fear of, helps to or prevents from overcoming obstacles, helps in or holds back from setting and achieving goals, and so forth.

It doesn't really matter whether one has positive or negative principles and values. The worst case is when a person doesn't hold any of them. The second worst is to be trapped by messing the core foundations with external attributes, and thinking that you know yours. Lastly, there is no pride in not willing to figure out what they are. Only by knowing and following the principles one can live a meaningful life. Living such a life starts from learning about these concepts, identifying what resonates with you, by becoming your true self. But in order to achieve that, one must answer a question.

This question is one the most important questions in life. There is no way to give an answer and never think about it again. By regularly asking this question a person opens themself to change, to growth. The person then evolves, and thrives, if works hard enough, and acknowledges their ignorance.

Next time passing a mirror, stop for a moment, look at the reflection and ask the question.

**Who are you?**
